level 04: Distorted / Broken worlds
level ??: leap of faith

death by height condition

maybe: make the x / y camera follow limit per level?
intro to spikes level
moving blocks +- 9.73?
pushable blocks
[TEST] players on different y column
---

polish:
- camera shake: on player death, landing from a jump
- death animation
- maybe camera follow speed will increase in case of horizontal movement?
- [DONE] fading
- [extra] level selector

design: should player fall down if one of them is grounded and the other is
not?


NOTE: Wall / Collider Color hex: 292626



idea: rotated platform
idea: no way as the way, no one way to do things

theme: troubles of a bond, there will be restricitions in the path, we need
sacrifices / different ways to tackle the problem to solve it compared to when
we are alone

things get difficult in a bond, but sometimes, we achieve the things we
couldn't have done without it

the bond becomes a burden in some puzzles
sometimes, we might think breaking up the bond might make some of the puzzles
easier, but it would make reaching some of the puzzles impossible

compromises and sacrifices
